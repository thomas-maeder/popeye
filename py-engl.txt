Some remarks on the distribution of popeye:

Popeye is free software. Everybody may get the source of popeye. We
believe that this software should be public and does not constitute
our own personal property - even we have invested a lot of work in
it. This work cannot be waged by money, and also we devote our time to
popeye not to earn money.

The only restriction that we impose is that Popeye be distributed in
its entirety.


Providing feedback:

The preferred way of submitting bug reports or feature requests is
through the tools offered on github.com .

Please direct your browser to
https://github.com/thomas-maeder/popeye/issues

Use the "Add new" link and fill out the "Summary" and "Description"
with the information you'd like to submit, then use the "Add Artifact"
button to submit your bug report or feature request.



Starting popeye:

Change the name of your preferred executable to py.exe
To operate it from the terminal:                py
To solve problems recorded in file XX:          py XX

Commandline parameters:
-maxmem
	You can provide for Popeye for example 40960 kilobyte (or 40 megabye)
	of memory with
		 -maxmem 40960    resp.    -maxmem 40M
	to speed up solving.
	Popeye uses this memory to avoid testing the same intermediate
	positions repeatedly. You can indicate -maxmem 0 to turn off this
	optimisation.

-maxtime
	Indicate the maximum number of seconds that Popeye may spend
	on each problem. This command line option is
	equivalent to the option maxtime that can be used in the problem
	definition (see below).
	Example:
		-maxtime 60
	If a problem hasn't been solved after one minute, solving
	continues with the next problem in the input file (if any).

-regression
	FOR DEVELOPERS MAINLY
	Popeye version info and solving times are suppressed from
	output files.


Stopping Popeye:

        press  CTRL + C  key combination



Description of the input language of popeye:

The input to popeye is not case sensitive. Every input to popeye starts with
the reserved word `BeginProblem'. After entering this command to popeye,
following commands may be used:

	remark, author, origin, title, protocol,
        condition, option, stipulation, sstipulation, forsyth, pieces, twin

The order of these commands is free, and can also occur more times.
The last of the commands in the second line is relevant. All of these
commands expect further parameters. Lets start with the simpler commands:

 - remark: this keyword introduces a comment. Everything up to the end of the
	line will be ignored and has no further effects.

 - author: The parameter to this command is the author of the problem. All
	Text up to end of line will be put above the diagram in the output.
	This input is completely optional and has no effect to the other
	capabilities of the program. All the input of multiple author
	commands will be placed on the output.

 - origin: All the same as the author command.
 - title:  All the same as the author command.

 - protocol: The parameter to his command is interpreted as filename, and all
	further output of popeye on the screen is also placed in the given
	file. If the file exists already, the output of popeye is appended to
	the file. The file will not be deleted.

 - condition: All the conditions neccessary for the problem, seperated by
	blanks or newline, should be given to this command.

	After the conditions Imitator, MagicSquare, Hole,
	WhitePromSquares, BlackPromSquares or one of
	the ForcedSquares, list the squares on which the imitators are
	to be placed, where the special squares are located, where
	promoted pieces (FrischaufCirce) are located, or where the
	white or black promotionsquares are located.

	The condition PromOnly must be followed by a list of piece types,
	separated through blanks. Promotion is only allowed into those
	piece types.

	The condition ChameleonCirce can be followed by a list of
	piece types, separated by blanks. The list determines how
	pieces change their type before being reborn. (Examples:
		"ChameleonCirce S B R Q S" is ordinary Chameleon-Circe
			and equivalent to "ChameleonCirce"
		"ChameleonCirce S Q R B S" gives reverse ChameleonCirce.)

	In the condition ChameleonChess, the same notation can be used
	to define the piece type sequence of all officers. And the 
	auxiliary condition ChameleonSequence can be used to define that
	sequence of the explicitly indicated chameleons.

	After Madrasi and PowerTransfer, you can enter "RexInclusive".

	After the Isardam condition, "TypeB" and then "RexInclusive" can be
	specified.

	After the SingleBox condition, "Type1", "Type2" or "Type3" can
	be entered.

	After the RepublicanChess condition, "Type1" or "Type2" can
	be indicated; Type2 is the default.

	After the list of magic square, "Type1" or "Type2" can
	be indicated; Type1 is the default.

	After the Sentinelles condition "PionAdvers", "PionNeutre",
	"ParaSentinelles", or "Berolina" can be entered, and also
	"MaximumWhite", "MaximumBlack" or "MaximumTotal" followed by a
	number.

	After MessignyChess, (Bi)Woozles, (Bi)Heffalumps and Protean
	Chess you can enter "RexExclusive".

	After the WhiteOscillatingKings or BlackOscillatingKings
	condition "TypeB" or or "TypeC" can be entered.

	After GridChess, various variantes can be entered.
	VerticalShift, HorizontalShift and DiagonalShift produce the
	normal grid shifted by one rank and/or file. E.g. the cell
	containing the square a1 consists of:
		VerticalShift:		a1b1
		HorizontalShift:	a1a2
		DiagonalShift:		a1
	Orthogonal followed by a list of files (to the left of any
	grid lines) and ranks (below any grid lines) all without
	spaces between.
	Irregular followed by space-separated lists of square groups
	forming the grid cells. N.B. The largest square group can be
	omitted as all remaining squares not specified will form 
	another group. 
	For example the standard grid can be described by any of
		condition grid
		condition grid orthogonal bdf246
		condition grid irregular a8a7b8b7 c8c7d8d7 ...
	Specifying   
	   condition grid irregular
	with no squares listed will make all moves illegal.
	GridLine followed by a list of lines will add extra lines to
	the grid. This should be used only to specify partial lines that
	do not subdivide a grid cell, (i.e. to allow some moves to be
	legal within a grid cell) as specifying cells is more
	efficient. The grid lines must be specified in 4 characters e.g.
		condition grid gridline Ha24 Vc61
	will draw a horizontal grid line from the bottom-left corner of
	a2 for 4 squares and a vertical line from the bottom-left corner
	of c6 for 1 square, on top of the normal grid. 
	To draw grid lines on a blank board, i.e. with no regular grid, 
	specify
		condition grid irregular gridline Ha24 Vc61
	(N.B. In the context of grid chess, moves go as straight lines
	from square centre to square centre; pieces that do not move
	in straight lines may not behave as expected; moves are permitted
	which merely touch the end of a gridline (e.g with gridline Ve11 
	and wKd1, the move Kd1-e2 is legal).
	
	After any of the VaultingKings conditions, a space-separated
	list of piece types may be given. The checked king will move
	additionally as one of the piece types in the list. If the
	option Transmuting is given, the checked king will move only
	as one of the pieces in the list (not as king). If no piece
	type is given, the checked king (additionally) moves as
	equihopper.
	
	After the MustCapture, Maximummer and Minimummer conditions,
	the keyword "Ultra" indicates that the respective Ultra
	condition is intended.

	After RoleExchange, the maximum number of RoleExchanges can be indicated.
	Without this indication, the number is unlimited.
	
	After Circe, AntiCirce, MarsCirce, AntiMarsCirce, ImmunChess,
	PhantomChess and GenevaChess, a number of options can be indicated; the
	options can be combined in various ways. Not
	all combinations make sense, and not all options make sense for
	all base conditions.
	In addition, options who belong to the same of the following 8 groups
	are normally mutually exclusive.
	Inclusion of the kings:
		RexInclusive	(default for AntiCirce and MarsCirce)
		RexExclusive	(default otherwise)
	Relevant move/walk/side:	
		LastMove
		WaitCapture
		Clone		(also defines the walk of the reborn piece)
		Couscous
		Mirror		(special meaning for Equipollents - see below)
	Restrition to piece walk:

 - option: Everything which should be in effect should be given here as
	blank seperated list. The following is recognized:

	Try             calculate if a move is a try.
	Defence         this option is followed by a number indicating
			the number of defences which should be taken
			into consideration. For instance Defence 1 all
			real tries are calculated.
	TrivialTriesAvoid	Remove trivial tries from the output.
			Currently, refuted first moves delivering check
			are considered trivial.
	SetPlay         calculate setplay.
	NullMoves	Allows the moving side to play a null move.
			Servers for finding tempo tries.
	Threat          for moremovers: This option must be followed
			by an integer. The opposit party has defended
			when there is no threat in less or equal this
			number of moves.
	WhiteToPlay     white starts moving in helpplay.
	Variation       show threats and variations.
	MoveNumbers     Movenumber, already calculated move and cumulated
			solving time on output.
	StartMoveNumber This option is followed by the Movenumber
			popeye was interrupted at.
	UpToMoveNumber	This option is followed by the Movenumber
			Popeye will be interrupted at.
	NoWk            without white king
	NoBk            without black king
	Duplex          calculate stipulation for both sides
	NoThreat        calculate variations without calculating threats
	MaxSolutions    This option must be followed by an integer. Popeye
			stops calculating if this number of solutions 
			are reached.
	MaxFlightsquares  for moremovers: This option must be followed
			by an integer. The opposit party has defended
			when the number of flightsquares for it's king
			are more or equal this number.
	EnPassant       Must be followed by 3-4 squares which indicate the
			pawn move just played:
			- departure square
			- avoided squares
			- arrival square
			This information is used for potential en passant
			keys.
	CastlingMutuallyExclusive <wrooksquare><brooksquare>
			Castlings with the rooks that occupy the
			indicated squares in the game array are
			mutually exclusive.
                        Example: CastlingMutuallyExclusive a1h8
                        For indicating more than one pair of mutually
                        exclusive castlings, the option can used
                        multiple times.
	NoBoard         The chessboard is not printed to screen or into file.
	NoShortVariations  Short variations are suppressed on output.
	HalfDuplex      calculate stipulation only for the opponent side.
	PostKeyPlay     The position entered is considered to be the position
			after the key. Just the solution play is analysed.
	NonTrivial m n  A special option to solve/cook/test long self and
			(semi)reflex problems. The second argument n
			deter- mines which black moves are considered
			to be trivial - a move that can be met by a
			s#n (or r=n resp.). In long problems (more
			than n moves) black has at every stage at
			least one nontrivial move. I. e. a move that
			doesnot lead to a s#n. The first argument m
			determines how many additional nontrivial
			moves can be granted to black by white during
			the whole solving procedure.  Example: nontr 0
			1. This is the most restrictive option.  White
			forced to play moves that leave black with
			only one move not met by a s#1.
	Intelligent     intelligent (quick) solving of help(stale)mate
			moremovers.
			After the intelligent option, the maximum number of 
			solutions per (stale)mate position can be given.
			Note: doesn't find stalemates without king!
	MaxTime         This option must be followed by an integer. Popeye
			stops calculating if this number of seconds  
			solving time are reached.

	NoCastling	This option must be followed by the squares of those
			pieces that cannot castle anymore in the
			diagram position.
	Quodlibet       In s# or r# also direct mates are a solution.
	StopOnShortSolutions  Calculation is terminated after detecting of
			      short solutions.
	Beep            This option can be followed by an integer. Each time
			Popeye has found a solution it beeps a number
			of times.
	SuppressGrid    (Grid Chess) Suppress the rendition of grid lines 
			in text and LaTeX output.
	WriteGrid	(Grid Chess) Writes an additional board that
			the partition of the board into grid cells.
			Useful for irregular grids.
	KeepMatingPiece	Stop solving when there is no piece left that could
			deliver mate.
	LastCapture	Follow by a colour, piece and square as in the piece
			command. Specifies piece captured on move leading to 
			the diagram.
	GoalIsEnd	applicable if the goal doesn't lead to immobility
			(e.g. z, x): the play ends if the wrong side reaches
			the goal.
	MatesIn1	don't suppress mates in 1 in self play if play would
			allow longer variations)

 - sstipulation: The stipulation can also be indicated in "structured form".
	This form allows all stipulations to be indicated that can also be
	indicated in traditional form using the command "stipulation". In
	addition, it allows many more stipulations to be indicated.
	(Exception: pser stipulations are not supported currently)

	With sstipulation, the play is described as a tree structure. Play 
	starts at the root, continues through branches that may fork,
	and ends in one or more leaves. After the keyword sstipulation, 
	indicate the root by specifying the side to move, then the branches
	and the leaves in the language as specified below.


	Anatomy of a sstipulation
	-------------------------

	Example: sstipulation white 5s[#]

	In this stipulation, it is White to move. Play consists of a
	branch that leads into a leaf. The branch consists of 5
	*s*eries moves. The leaf simply tests whether a mate has been
	reached.

        The definition of a branch normally consists of:
	- the maximum length in half-moves (in the example: 5)
	- the type of the branch           (s for series)
	- leaves                           (#)
	- forks                            (don't occur in the example)
        - constraints                      (don't occur in the example)

	Play ends in one or multiple leaves. Their definition normally
	consists of the goal (in the example: #) to be reached.

	When changing from a branch to another or to a leaf, the right
	to move is changed. In the example, it is Black to move in the
	leaf, i.e. the leaf tests whether Black is mate.

	The example is thus a synonym for

	stipulation ser-#5


	Branch types
	------------

	Type           Notation    Examples        Synonyms as stipulation
	Series         s           5s[#]           ser-#5
	"Battle play"  ad          3a[+]d, 4ad[x]  +2, sx2
	               da          3d[==]a         s==2 option postkeyplay
	Help play      hh          5h[=]h          h=2.5

	The letters s (series move), a (attacking move), d (defending
	move) and h (help move) each represent a half-move.

	A fork following a, h or s defines what the respective move is
	supposed to reach, and a fork following d what the move
	defends against.

	Note: a da branch is solvable if the side to move DOES NOT have
	a refutation.


	Fork into a branch
	------------------

	A fork leads into a nested branch.

	Examples        Synonyms as stipulation
        3a[1a[#]d]d     semi-r#2
	4hh[1a[#]d]     not supported (Help-Semireflexmate in 2.5)
	6s[1d[#]a]      ser-s#6


	Branches with more than one fork or leaf
	----------------------------------------

	After each half-move, both a leaf and a fork can be indicated.

	Examples        Synonyms as stipulation
	4a[#=]d[#=]     s#=2 option quodlibet
        3a[#][1a[#]d]d  semi-r#2 option quodlibet


	Logical expressions
	-------------------

	The following operators can be applied to leaves and branches
	to form expressions:

	Operator  Meaning
	!         Negation
        |         OR
	&         AND

	Examples         Meaning  
	!#               the side to move is not mate
	!3a[#]d          there is no solution to a direct twomover
	4ad[#] | 3h[#]h  s#2 or h#1.5
	1h[#]h & 2hh[#]  #1 and h#1 (i.e. reci-h#1)

	Both operands of the binary operators have to belong to the
	same of the following groups:
	- leaf     # = zh1 ...
	- attack   ad hh s
	- defense  da

	An expression belongs to the same group as its operand(s) and
	can therefore be the operand of an expression, e.g. (as
	alternative to triplets):

	3a[#]d & 4hh[#] & 4ad[#]

	The three partial expressions as well as the & expressions
	belong to the attack group.


	Operators are normally evaluated from left to right. If
	necessary, use () to define the proper precedence. E.g.

	4hh[#] & ( 4ad[#] | 4hh[=] )


	Constraints
	-----------

	Constraints can be indicated in branches using curly braces
	({}).

	Example                Synonym as stipulation
        3a[1a[#]d]d{!1a[#]d}   r#2

	Note: even if the constraint follows the d, it is enforced
	BEFORE each attacking move (including the first one!). The
	problem has thus no solution if the constraint is violated in
	the diagram.

	The two principal differences between nested branches/leaves
	and restrictions are:
	- the requirement expressed by the nested branch/leaf only
	  needs to be fulfilled at the end of play; a restriction,
	  however, has to be fulfilled each time before the respective
	  move is played
	- the moves played for the verification of a constraint don't
	  appear in the printed solution, with the following 2
	  exceptions:
	  * if a constraint is violated in the diagram position
	  * if the refutation of a try leads to a violated constraint
	    ("reflex defense")


	Branches with minimal length
	----------------------------

	The syntax m:n can be used to define a branch with minimal
	length (m=minimal, n=maximal length):

	Examples    synonym as stipulation
	4:4hh[#]    exact-h#2
	3:5s[#]     not supported (series mate in 3 to 5 moves)


	Special operators at the beginning of a branch
	----------------------------------------------

	The operators >, / and - can occur in this order at the
	beginning of branches.

	> at the beginning of the definition of a nested branch ends
	play in the containing branch in positions where the nested
	branch has a solution. E.g. a problem with

	sstipulation white 3h[1a[x]d]h

	can have the solutions

	1.g3-g4 h5*g4 x 
	1.g3-g4 h5*g4   2.h4-h5 g4*f3 x 

	The longer sequence is a solution although the goal has been
	reached after the first two half-moves already. If play is to
	end as soon as the goal is reached, write

	sstipulation white 3h[>1a[x]d]h


	The operator / at the beginning of a nested branch prevents
	the moves played in that branch from appearing in the output.

	E.g. the capturing moves forced by Zugzwang in CapZug
	stipulations are not part of the solution. Help CapZug in 2.5
	moves is thus defined as

	sstipulation black - 5h[/1d[x]a{!+}]h


	The side to move at the beginning of a branch can be changed
	using the - operator.

	Examples        Synonyms as stipulation
	- 7h[#]h        h#3.5
	3h[- 4hh[#]]h   not supported (h#4 without 2nd white move)


	Conditional right to move
	-------------------------

	The right to move can be restrained by a requirement R by prefixing the
	respective symbol (h resp. d) with ?R?.

	The right to move represented by a symbol decorated in this way is
	granted only if the requirement is fulfilled at the relevant time.

	Example: sstipulation white 7h[#]?+?h  (synonym of stipulation phser-#4)

	Currently, the only supported requirement R is that the side at the move
	be in check.

	In addition, ?R? is only applicaple in two contexts:
	- in ad to the d
	- in hh to the second h, provided that the maximum length of the branch
		is not divisible by 2

	Further examples:
	white 15a[#]?+?d			(pser-#8)
	white 15a[1d[#]a]?+?d			(pser-s#8)
	white 15a[>1a[#]d]?+?d			(pser-semi-r#8)
	white 15a[>1a[#]d]?+?d{!1a[#]d}		(pser-r#8)
	black 15h[1a[#]d]?+?h			(pser-h#8)
	white 15h[1d[#]a]?+?h			(phser-s#8)

All these commands up to now are very easy to use (except maybe
sstipulation). A little bit more elaborate are the commands

 - forsyth: With this command you can enter the position in forsyth notation.

	Examples: 
		rsbqkbsr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RSBQKBSR (game array)
		rsbqkbsrpppppppp32PPPPPPPPRSBQKBSR          (game array; alternative)
		48/5gPp/5K1k                                (V.Onitiu, #6 - black grasshopper)
		1.PA6/8/1Q2.ma3/8/k1.pa.pa4/8/1P1K          (Z.Mach, #2 - chinese pieces)

	Pieces represented by one letter in the "pieces" command are entered using that	
	same letter in the forsyth command. The squares are registered from a8 to h8, followed
	by a7 to h7, etc. down to h1. Runs of blank squares are registered by a number which
	counts the number of blanks, and the "/" character separates each rank.

	Lowercase letters represent black pieces and uppercase letters represent white pieces.
	The "/" character is optional. Runs of blanks squares of 10 or more can be entered. Blank
	squares after the last piece can be omitted (e.g. Mach example above, 4/8 has been omitted). 

	The notation is extended to allow input of fairy pieces as follows:
 
	 - a piece can begin with an optional colour specification character (which overrides use of a 
	 	lowercase/uppercase letter)
		+ 	White
		- 	Black
		= 	Neutral
		Examples:
		+g  White grasshopper (or +G)
		=p  Neutral pawn (or =P)

	 - a piece which is represented by two letters or digits in the "pieces" command can be entered
	   with the "forsyth" command by commencing with a ".". The first of the two following letters
	   determines whether it is white or black, unless a colour specifier is used. Examples:
	   .PA 	White Pao 
	   .ma  Black Mao  
	   .g2  Black Grasshopper-2
	   +.15 White (1,5)-leaper
	   -.15 Black (1,5)-leaper
	   =.li Neutral Lion

	   Note only the first of the two letters is checked for lowercase/uppercase to determine the colour.
	   It is only necessary to use a colour specifier +/-/= for neutral pieces, or for pieces whose  
	   representation is two digits. 
	   At present pieces with other attributes (paralysing, royal etc.) cannot be entered with this command. It
	   is possible to enter additional pieces with the "pieces" command, either before or after the "forsyth"
	   command (blank squares in the forsyth command will not be cleared)

 - pieces: This command specifies all the pieces belonging to the problem.
	After this keyword, the color of the following pieces must be given:
	This is one of:

	White
	Black
	Neutral

	After the color specification 

	Chameleon
	Jigger
	Kamikaze
	Paralysing
	Royal
	Volage
	Functionary
	HalfNeutral
	HurdleColourChanging          (only for hoppers !)
	Protean
	Magic
	Uncapturable
	FrischAuf
	Anda
	AndaInverse

	may be given. All the pieces given after this will have these
	attributes. After this specification follows the list of
	pieces: First the walk of the piece followed by the list of
	squares where pieces should be placed on. By giving a new color
	specifiation pieces of another color may be entered without
	repeating the pieces command.

	If a piece is placed on an occupied square, the previous piece
	is transfered below the square to the top of the underworld. In the
	fairy conditions Circe Volcanic, Circe Parachute, GhostChess and
	HauntedChess, moves from that square cause pieces from the underworld
	to be transfered back into the real world. Otherwise, pieces in the
	underworld allow promoting pawns into their walk.

	Popeye supports the following piece walks:

	15      1,5-leaper
	16      1,6-leaper
	24      2,4-leaper
	25      2,5-leaper
	35      3,5-leaper

	The "pseudo color" TotalInvisible followed by a positive number
	may be used to indicate the number of TotalInvisible pieces.


 - Twin: Solving/testing of positions obtained by small changes of the
	initial position. The following specifications are supported:
    Stipulation ...: The stipulation is changed. See the repective basic
	command.
    Condition ...: Cange of fairy conditions. The old conditions are
	subsituted by those put in.
    Move <square1> <square2>: Move the piece from square1 to square2. A
	piece accidentally standing on square2 will be removed. Example:
	twin move a3 b4.
    Exchange <square1> <square2>: The pieces on <square1> and <square2>
	exchange places. Example: twin exchange a3 b4.
    Remove <square>: The piece located on the square specified is removed.
	Example: twin remove e5.
    Substitute <piece1> <piece2>: All pieces of type <piece1> are replaced
	by pieces of type <piece2>. Colour and further piece specifications
	(like paralysing etc.) are not affected. Example: twin
	substitute R B.  All rooks are replaced by bishops.
    Add <colour> <piecespecs> <type><squarelist>: Add pieces - present pieces
	are replaced.
	Example: twin add black para NHa6 - a black paralysing NightriderHopper is
	added on a6. See the basic command "pieces".
	The "pseudo color" TotalInvisible followed by a positive number can
	be used to indicate twinning by modification of the number of TotalInvisible
	pieces.
    Rotate n: Turns the board by n degrees to the left (n=90, 180, 270).
	Example: twin rotate 180.
    Mirror a1<-->h1: Mirrors the position on the vertical middle line.
    Mirror a1<-->a8: Mirrors the position on the horizontal middle line.
    Mirror a1<-->h8: Mirrors the position on the diagonal a8-h1.
    Mirror a8<-->h1: Mirrors the position on the diagonal a1-h8.
	So, not the mirror line is given, but square into which a1 (or h1)
	is turned into.
    Shift <square1> <square2>: Shift the whole position into the direction
	determined by the two squares entered. Example: twin shift a1 a2 -
	all pieces are moved one square up.
    PolishType: All pieces change colour.
	More than one change may be specified, for example twin rem e7
	add white qe8. As you can see the twinning commands can abreviated.
	By default the changes refer to the position initially set.
	Alternatively the changes can be applied to the position solved most
	recently. Just enter "continued" (or "cont") immediately after
	"twin". Example twin cont rem a1.

 - ZeroPosition: This command can be used alternatively to the command
	"twin". It indicates that the initial position is not for solving.
	The command must be followed by the changes for the first position
	to be solved. Example: zero move b4 d5
			       twin move c5 b5.

When all data have been entered to describe completely the problem,
the solving may be started by giving the keyword `endproblem' to
popeye.
Immediately after reading this, provided no input errors were discovered,
popeye starts to solve the problem.

Here comes a sample:

BeginProblem
Author          Unknown
Origin          Also Unkown
Stipulation     #2
Pieces          White   Ka3 Ra8
		Black   Kb1
Option          MoveNumbers Try Set Variation
EndProblem


This input seems long and cumbersome. But Popeye recognizes the keywords
as long as the shortage is unique. The above input may also be written
like this:


Begi
Auth    Unknown
Orig    Also Unkown
Stie    #2
Piec    Whit Ka3 Ra8
	Blac Kb1
Opti    Move Try Set Vari
Endp

In the future the minimum length of unique shortages changes, when popeyes
capabilities are increased. But we try to keep all keywords uniq within the
first four characters. If they are now uniq with less than four, its not
guaranteed for the future.

If there are more problems to be solved in one run, you can replace the
`EndProblem' directive with `NextProblem'. After this, popeye expects
an new problem specification, after he has solved the previous one.
The last problem specification should be finished with `EndProblem'.
