### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)  
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing  
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building  
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity  

---

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean  
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents  
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents  
- One task per subagent for focused execution  

---

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern  
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake  
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops  
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project  

---

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works  
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant  
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"  
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness  

---

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"  
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"  
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer  
- Challenge your own work before presenting it  

---

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding  
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them  
- Zero context switching required from the user  
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items  
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation  
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go  
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step  
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`  
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections  

---

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code  
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

## RTK Commands by Workflow

### Git (59-80% savings)
```bash
rtk git status          # Compact status
rtk git log             # Compact log (works with all git flags)
rtk git diff            # Compact diff (80%)
rtk git show            # Compact show (80%)
rtk git add             # Ultra-compact confirmations (59%)
rtk git commit          # Ultra-compact confirmations (59%)
rtk git push            # Ultra-compact confirmations
rtk git pull            # Ultra-compact confirmations
rtk git branch          # Compact branch list
rtk git fetch           # Compact fetch
rtk git stash           # Compact stash
rtk git worktree        # Compact worktree
```

### Files & Search (60-75% savings)
```bash
rtk ls <path>           # Tree format, compact (65%)
rtk read <file>         # Code reading with filtering (60%)
rtk grep <pattern>      # Search grouped by file (75%)
rtk find <pattern>      # Find grouped by directory (70%)
```

### Analysis & Debug (70-90% savings)
```bash
rtk err <cmd>           # Filter errors only from any command
rtk log <file>          # Deduplicated logs with counts
rtk json <file>         # JSON structure without values
rtk deps                # Dependency overview
rtk env                 # Environment variables compact
rtk summary <cmd>       # Smart summary of command output
rtk diff                # Ultra-compact diffs
```

### Meta Commands
```bash
rtk gain                # View token savings statistics
rtk gain --history      # View command history with savings
rtk discover            # Analyze Claude Code sessions for missed RTK usage
rtk proxy <cmd>         # Run command without filtering (for debugging)
rtk init                # Add RTK instructions to CLAUDE.md
rtk init --global       # Add RTK to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

## Token Savings Overview

| Category | Commands | Typical Savings |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Git | status, log, diff, add, commit | 59-80% |
| Package Managers | pnpm, npm, npx | 70-90% |
| Files | ls, read, grep, find | 60-75% |

Overall average: **60-90% token reduction** on common development operations.
