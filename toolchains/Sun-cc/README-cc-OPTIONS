DESCRIPTION
     The cc(1) manual page  describes  the  ANSI/ISO  C  compiler
     options  that  are  SVID  compliant  under  Solaris versions
     2.5.1, 2.6, Solaris 7. _cccc_cccc uses _gggg_eeee_tttt_oooo_pppp_tttt to parse  command-line
     options. Options are treated as a single letter or as a sin-
     gle letter followed by an argument.  See _gggg_eeee_tttt_oooo_pppp_tttt(3c).

     _cccc_cccc is the interface to the C compilation system.  The compi-
     lation  process  incorporates a preprocessor, compiler, code
     generator,  optimizer,  assembler,  and  link  editor.    _cccc_cccc
     processes the supplied options and then executes the various
     components with the proper arguments.   _cccc_cccc  accepts  several
     types of files as arguments.

     Files with _...._cccc suffix are taken to be C source files and  may
     be  preprocessed, compiled, optimized, instrumented for pro-
     filing,   assembled,   and   link   edited.   Although   the

     preprocessor  can  be used as a macro processor, this is not
     recommended, as its output is geared toward that which would
     be  acceptable as input to a valid C compiler.  The compila-
     tion process may be stopped after the completion of any pass
     if the appropriate options are supplied.  If the compilation
     process runs through the assembler, then an object  file  is
     produced with _...._oooo suffix substituted for _...._cccc.  However, the _...._oooo
     file is normally deleted if a single C file is compiled  and
     then  immediately  link  edited.   Files  with _...._ssss suffix are
     taken to be assembly source files; they may be assembled and
     link edited.  Files with a _...._SSSS suffix are treated as _----_XXXX_ssss mode
     of the compiler and passed to _////_uuuu_ssss_rrrr_////_cccc_cccc_ssss_////_llll_iiii_bbbb_////_cccc_pppp_pppp  for  prepro-
     cessing before being passed to the assembler.  Files with an
     _...._iiii are taken to be preprocessed C source files, and  may  be
     compiled,  optimized, instrumented for profiling, assembled,
     and link edited.  Files whose names do not end in _...._cccc, _...._ssss, _...._SSSS
     or _...._iiii are passed to the link editor, which produces a dynam-
     ically linked executable whose name by default is _aaaa_...._oooo_uuuu_tttt.

     Incremental Link Editor (_iiii_llll_dddd) is used in place of linker  _llll_dddd
     for  incremental  linking. See -xildon and -xildoff for more
     information.

     See option -Y_c, _d_i_r to change the default  directories  used
     for  finding  libraries. _d_i_r is a colon-separated path list.
     The default library search order for cc is:
            /opt/SUNWspro/SC5.0/lib
            /usr/ccs/lib
            /usr/lib

COMPILING FOR 64-BIT SOLARIS 7:
     This version of  the  compiler  can  produce  64-bit  object
     binaries  on  32-bit or 64-bit Solaris 7 SPARC Platform Edi-
     tion.  The resulting executable  will  run  only  on  64-bit
     SPARC  or UltraSPARC processors under Solaris 7 with the 64-
     bit kernel.  Compilation, linking, and execution  of  64-bit
     objects can only take place in a Solaris 7 environment.

     Compiling for 64-bit Solaris 7 is indicated by the -xarch=v9
     and  -xarch=v9a options. Note that one of these options must
     be specified even if -xtarget or -fast are  also  specified.
     In  such  a  case, the -xarch=v9 (or -xarch=v9a) option must
     appear AFTER any -xtarget or other option that sets  -xarch.
     For example:

           -xtarget=ultra -xarch=v9

     Note that -xtarget=ultra and -xtarget=ultra2 imply -xarch=v8
     and do not automatically signal -xarch=v9 or v9a.

     When building shared dynamic libraries with -xarch=v9 or v9a
     on 64-bit Solaris 7, the -xcode=pic13 or -xcode=pic32 option

     MUST also be specified.

     See also the new -xcode=abs32|abs64|pic13|pic32  option  for
     specifying code address sizes.

     64-bit Solaris 7 not only enables 64-bit integer and pointer
     data,  but  also  support for large files. For more details,
     see the README file:

      <install-directory>/SUNWspro/READMEs/64bit_Compilers

     (where <install-directory> is usually  /opt  in  a  standard
     install.)

     For general  information  on  64-bit  Solaris  for  software
     developers,  see the "Solaris 7 64-bit Developer's Guide" in
     AnswerBook2


OPTIONS
     All platform-specific options are "silently accepted" on all
     platforms.  Any  exceptions to this rule are noted under the
     specific option.

     The following options are interpreted by _cccc_cccc:

     -#   Show each component as it is invoked (verbose mode).

     -### Show each component as it is invoked, but,  unlike  the
          -# option, do not actually execute.

          The above are not predefined in -Xc mode.

          If -A is followed by a dash (-)  only,  it  causes  all
          predefined macros (other than those that begin with __)
          and predefined assertions to be forgotten.

     -B [static|dynamic]
          Specifies whether bindings of libraries for linking are
          static  or  dynamic,  indicating  whether libraries are
          non-shared or shared, respectively.  -B dynamic  causes
          the  link  editor  to  look for files named _llll_iiii_bbbb_x_...._ssss_oooo and
          then for files named _llll_iiii_bbbb_x_...._aaaa when given the _----_llll_x  option.

          -B static causes the link editor to look only for files
          named _llll_iiii_bbbb_x_...._aaaa.  This option may  be  specified  multiple
          times on the command line as a toggle.  This option and
          its argument are passed to _llll_dddd.

     -C   Prevents the C  preprocessor  from  removing  comments,
          other than those on preprocessing directive lines.

     -c   Suppresses the link editing phase  of  the  compilation
          and produces a _...._oooo file for each source file.

     -D_n_a_m_e[=_t_o_k_e_n]
          Associates _n_a_m_e with the specified _t_o_k_e_n  as  if  by  a

          The compiler also predefines the object-like macro
                   __PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME,
          to indicate the pragma will be recognized.

     -d [y|n]
          -dy specifies dynamic linking, which is the default, in
          the  link  editor.  -dn specifies static linking in the
          link editor.

          This option and its argument are passed to _llll_dddd.

     -E   Preprocesses only the  named  C  files  and  sends  the
          result  to  the  standard  output.  The output contains
          preprocessing directives for use by the  next  pass  of
          the compilation system.  See also -P option.

     -erroff=_t
          Suppresses cc warning messages. Has no effect on  error
          messages.

          The -erroff values are  members  of  a  comma-separated
          list that consists of one or more of the following:

          _t_a_g      Suppresses the warning  message  specified  by
                   this  _t_a_g.  You can display the tag for a mes-
                   sage by using the -errtags=yes option.

          no%_t_a_g   Enables the warning message specified by  this
                   _t_a_g.

          %all     Suppresses all warning messages.

          %none    Enables all  warning  messages.  This  is  the
                   default.

          Order is important; for example, %all,no%_t_a_g suppresses
          all warning messages except _t_a_g.

          The default is  -erroff=%none.  Specifying  -erroff  is
          equivalent to specifying -erroff=%all.

          Finer control over messages can be  achieved  with  the
          use of the _e_r_r_o_r__m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s pragma.

     -errtags=_a
          Displays the message tag for each error message. _a  can
          be either yes or no. The default is -errtags=no. Speci-
          fying   -errtags   is    equivalent    to    specifying
          -errtags=yes.

     -fast
          Selects the optimum combination of compilation  options
          for  speed.   This  should provide close to the maximum
          performance for most realistic  applications.   Modules
          compiled with -fast , must also be linked with -fast .

          The -fast option is unsuitable for  programs  that  are
          intended to run on a different target than the compila-
          tion machine. In such  cases,  follow  -fast  with  the
          appropriate -xtarget option. For example:

                % cc -fast -xtarget=ultra

          For C modules depending on exception handling specified
          by  SUID,  follow  -fast by -xnolibmil The -fast option
          acts like a macro expansion on the command line. There-
          fore,  you  can  override any of the expanded optionsby
          following -fast with the desired option.


          If you combine  -fast  with  other  options,  the  last
          specification applies.  The code generation option, the
          optimization level and using inline template files  can
          be  overridden  by  subsequent  switches.  For example,
          although the optimization part of -fast  is  -xO4,  the
          optimization part of -fast -xO1 is -xO1.

          These options are turned on for -fast:

          -xtarget=native

          -xO4

          -fns

          -fsimple=1 (_S_P_A_R_C)

          -nofstore (_x_8_6)

          IEEE  754  floating-point  arithmetic  is  nonstop, and
          underflows are gradual.

          -fnonstd is a macro for -fns and -ftrap=common.

     -fns[={_n_o,_y_e_s}]
          Select SPARC nonstandard floating point (_S_P_A_R_C _O_n_l_y).

          Select the SPARC nonstandard floating-point mode.   The
          default,  -fns=no,  is  SPARC  standard  floating-point
          mode.

          Optional use of =_y_e_s or =_n_o provides a way of  toggling
          the  -fns  flag  following  some  other macro flag that
          includes -fns, such as -fast.

          -fns is the same as -fns=yes.
          -fns=yes selects non-standard floating-point.
          -fns=no selects standard floating-point.

          This flag causes the nonstandard floating point mode to
          be   enabled  when  a  program  begins  execution.   By
          default, the nonstandard floating point mode  will  not
          be enabled automatically.

          On some SPARC systems, the nonstandard  floating  point
          mode disables "gradual underflow", causing tiny results
          to be flushed to zero rather than  producing  subnormal
          numbers.   It  also  causes  subnormal  operands  to be
          silently replaced by zero.  On those SPARC systems that
          do  not support gradual underflow and subnormal numbers
          in hardware,  use  of  this  option  can  significantly
          improve the performance of some programs.

          Warning: When nonstandard  mode  is  enabled,  floating
          point  arithmetic  may produce results that do not con-
          form to the requirements of the IEEE 754 standard.  See
          the Numerical Computation Guide for more information.

          This option is effective only on SPARC systems and only
          if  used  when compiling the main program.  On x86 sys-
          tems, the option is ignored.


     -fprecision=_p
          (_x_8_6) Initializes the rounding precision mode  bits  in
          the  Floating-point  Control Word to _p, which is one of
          single (24 bits), double (53  bits),  or  extended  (64
          bits)   respectively.    The   default   floating-point
          rounding-precision mode is extended.

          Note that on Intel, only the precision,  not  exponent,

          range  is  affected  by  the  setting of floating-point
          rounding precision mode.

          This option is effective only on x86 systems  and  only
          if used when compiling the main program.  On SPARC sys-
          tems, the option is ignored.

     -fround=_r
          Sets the IEEE 754 rounding mode that is established  at
          runtime during the program initialization.

          _r must be one of: nearest, tozero, negative, positive.

          The default is -fround=nearest.

          The meanings are the same as those for  the  _iiii_eeee_eeee_eeee______ffff_llll_aaaa_gggg_ssss
          subroutine.

          When r is "tozero",  "negative",  or  "positive",  this
          flag  causes  the  rounding direction mode to be set to
          round-to-zero, round- to-negative-infinity,  or  round-
          to-positive-infinity respectively when a program begins
          execution.  When r is "nearest" or the -fround flag  is
          not  used,  the  rounding direction mode is not altered
          from its initial value (round-to-nearest by default).

          This option is effective only if  used  when  compiling
          the main program.

     -fsimple[=_n]
          Allows the optimizer to  make  simplifying  assumptions
          concerning  floating-point arithmetic. If _n is present,
          it must be 0, 1, or 2.

          The defaults are:
          o  With no -fsimple[=n], the compiler uses -fsimple=0.
          o  With only -fsimple, no =n, the compiler uses  -fsim-
          ple=1.

          -fsimple=0
          Permits no simplifying  assumptions.  Preserves  strict
          IEEE 754 conformance.

          -fsimple=1
          Allows conservative simplifications. The resulting code
          does  not  strictly  conform  to  IEEE 754, but numeric
          results of most programs are unchanged.

          With -fsimple=1, the optimizer can assume  the  follow-
          ing:
          o  The IEEE 754 default rounding/trapping modes do  not
          change after process initialization.

          o Computations producing no visible result  other  than
          potential floating- point exceptions may be deleted.
          o Computations with Infinity or NaNs as  operands  need
          not  propagate  NaNs to their results. For example, x*0
          may be replaced by 0.
          o Computations do not depend on sign of zero.

          With -fsimple=1, the optimizer is not allowed to optim-
          ize  completely  without  regard  to roundoff or excep-
          tions. In particular, a floating-point computation can-
          not  be replaced by one that produces different results
          with rounding modes held constant at  run  time.  -fast
          implies -fsimple=1.

          -fsimple=2
          Permits aggressive floating  point  optimizations  that
          may  cause  many  programs to produce different numeric
          results due to changes in rounding. For example, -fsim-
          ple=2 permits the optimizer to attempt replacing compu-
          tations of x/y in a given loop where y and z are  known
          to  have constant values, with x*z, where z=1/y is com-
          puted once and saved in a temporary, thereby  eliminat-
          ing costly divide operations.

          Even with -fsimple=2, the optimizer still is  not  per-
          mitted  to  introduce  a  floating point exception in a
          program that otherwise produces none.

     -fsingle
          (-Xt and -Xs modes only)  Causes the compiler to evalu-
          ate  float expressions as single precision, rather than
          double precision.  (This option has no  effect  if  the
          compiler  is  used in either -Xa or -Xc modes, as float
          expressions are already evaluated as single precision.)

     -fstore
          (_x_8_6) Causes the compiler to convert  the  value  of  a
          floating-point  expression  or  function to the type on
          the left-hand side of an assignment, when that  expres-
          sion or function is assigned to a variable, or when the
          expression is cast to a  shorter  floating-point  type,
          rather  than  leaving the value in the register. Due to
          roundoffs and truncation, the results may be  different
          from  those  generated from the register value. This is
          the default mode.

     -ftrap=_t
          Sets the IEEE 754 trapping mode in effect at startup.

          _t is a comma-separated list that  consists  of  one  or
          more   of   the   following:   %all,   %none,   common,
          [no%]invalid,      [no%]overflow,       [no%]underflow,

          [no%]division, [no%]inexact.

          The default is -ftrap=%none.

          This option sets the IEEE 754 trapping modes  that  are
          established  at  program initialization.  Processing is
          left-to-right.  The common exceptions,  by  definition,
          are invalid, division by zero, and overflow.

          Example: -ftrap=%all,no%inexact means  set  all  traps,
          except inexact.

          The meanings are the same as for the _iiii_eeee_eeee_eeee______ffff_llll_aaaa_gggg_ssss subrou-
          tine, except that:
          o %all turns on all the trapping modes.
          o %none, the default, turns off all trapping modes.
          o A no% prefix turns off that specific trapping mode.

          If you compile one routine with -ftrap=_t,  compile  all
          routines  of the program with the same -ftrap=_t option;
          otherwise, you can get unexpected results.

     -G   Directs the link editor  to  produce  a  shared  object
          rather  than  a  dynamically  linked  executable.  This
          option is passed to _llll_dddd.  It cannot be used with the _----_dddd_nnnn
          option.

     -g   Produces  additional  symbol  table   information   for
          dbx(1).

          The -g option causes the invocation of the  incremental
          linker  option. See -xildon.  Invoke ild in place of ld
          unless any of the following are true:  The -G option is
          present,  the  -xildoff  option  is present, any source
          files are named on the command line.

          When used with the  _----_OOOO  option,  a  limited  amount  of
          debugging is available. The combination, _----_xxxx_OOOO_4444 _----_gggg, turns
          off the inlining that you usually get with _----_xxxx_OOOO_4444.

     -H   Prints, one per  line,  the  path  name  of  each  file
          included  during  the  current  compilation to standard
          output.

     -h _n_a_m_e
          Assigns a name to a shared dynamic library; allows  you
          to keep different versions of a library.

          In general, the _n_a_m_e after _----_hhhh should be the same as the
          file  name given in the _----_oooo option. The space between _----_hhhh
          and _n_a_m_e is optional.

          The linker assigns the specified _n_a_m_e  to  the  library
          and records the name in the library file as the _i_n_t_r_i_n_-
          _s_i_c name of the library. If there is no _----_hhhh _n_a_m_e option,
          then no intrinsic name is recorded in the library file.

          When the runtime linker loads the library into an  exe-
          cutable  file,  it  copies  the intrinsic name from the
          library file into the executable, into a list of needed
          shared library files. Every executable has such a list.
          If there is no intrinsic name of a shared library, then
          the  linker  copies the path of the shared library file
          instead.

     -I_d_i_r
          Looks in _d_i_r, prior to /usr/include, for included files
          whose  names  do not begin with slash (/).  Directories
          for multiple -I  options  are  searched  in  the  order
          specified.

     -i   Ignores the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting.

     -keeptmp
          Retains temporary  files  created  during  compilation,
          instead of deleting them automatically.

     -KPIC
          The -KPIC command is equivalent to -xcode=pic32.

     -L_d_i_r
          Adds _d_i_r  to  the  list  of  directories  searched  for
          libraries  by  _llll_dddd.   This  option and its arguments are
          passed to _llll_dddd.

     -l_n_a_m_e
          Links with object library _llll_iiii_bbbb_n_a_m_e_...._ssss_oooo or _llll_iiii_bbbb_n_a_m_e_...._aaaa  (for
          _llll_dddd(1)).  The  order of libraries in the command line is
          important, as symbols are resolved from left to  right.
          This option must follow the _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e.

          _cccc_cccc does not overwrite the source file.  This option and
          its argument are passed to _llll_dddd.

     -P   Preprocesses only the named  C  files  and  leaves  the
          result  in corresponding files suffixed _...._iiii.  The output
          will not contain  any  preprocessing  line  directives,
          unlike _----_EEEE.

     -p   Prepares the object code to collect data for  profiling
          with  _pppp_rrrr_oooo_ffff_((((_1111_))));  also,  if link editing takes place, use
          profiled versions of system libraries.  A _mmmm_oooo_nnnn_...._oooo_uuuu_tttt  file
          will  then  be produced at normal termination of execu-
          tion of the object program.  An execution  profile  can
          then be generated by use of _pppp_rrrr_oooo_ffff.

     -Q[_yyyy|_nnnn]
          Emits or does not emit  identification  information  to
          the output file.  If _yyyy is used, identification informa-
          tion about each invoked compilation tool will be  added
          to  the  output files (the default behavior).  This can
          be useful for software administration.  _----_QQQQ_nnnn  suppresses
          this information.

     -qp  Same as -p.

     -R_d_i_r[:_d_i_r]
          A colon-separated list of directories used  to  specify
          library  search  directories to the runtime linker.  If
          present and not null, it  is  recorded  in  the  output
          object file and passed to the runtime linker.

          If both LD_RUN_PATH and the -R  option  are  specified,
          the -R option takes precedence.

     -S   Compiles, but does not assemble or link edit the  named
          C  files.   The  assembler-language  output  is left in
          corresponding files suffixed _...._ssss.

     -s   Removes all symbolic  debugging  information  from  the
          output  object  file.   This option is passed to ld(1).
          This option cannot be specified with _----_gggg.

     -U_n_a_m_e
          Causes any definition of _n_a_m_e to be undefined, as if by
          a  #undef  preprocessing directive. If the same _n_a_m_e is
          specified for both -D and  -U,  _n_a_m_e  is  not  defined,
          regardless  of  the order of the options.  You can give

          the named C files.

     -W_c,_a_r_g
          Passes the argument _a_r_g to _c.  Each  argument  must  be
          separated from the preceding by only a comma.  (A comma
          can be part of an argument by escaping it by an immedi-
          ately  preceding backslash (_\\\\) character; the backslash
          is removed from the resulting argument.)  All -W  argu-
          ments  are  passed after the regular command-line argu-
          ments.

          _c can be one of the following:

               semantic  changes required by ANSI C.  Where K&R C
               and ANSI C specify  different  semantics  for  the
               same  construct,  the compiler will issue warnings
               about the conflict and use the ANSI C  interpreta-
               tion. This is the default compiler mode.

          _cccc (conformance)
               Strictly conformant ANSI/ISO C, without K&R C com-

               errors and warnings for  programs  that  use  non-

               The compiled language includes all features compa-

               to warn about all language  constructs  that  have
               differing  behavior between Sun ANSI/ISO C and the
               K&R C. Invokes cpp for processing. ___________SSSS_TTTT_DDDD_CCCC__________ is not

               ANSI/ISO C plus K&R  C  compatibility  extensions,
               without  semantic  changes required by ANSI/ISO C.
               Where K&R  C  and  ANSI/ISO  C  specify  different
               semantics  for  the  same  construct, the compiler
               will issue warnings about the conflict and use the
               K&R C interpretation.

          All warning messages about differing  behavior  can  be
          eliminated through appropriate coding; for example, use
          of casts can eliminate the  integral  promotion  change
          warnings.

          source  file.   The  tcov(1) utility can then be run on
          the source file to generate statistics about  the  pro-
          gram. This option is incompatible with -g .

          If set at compile-time, the TCOVDIR  environment  vari-
          able  specifies  the  directory  where the .d files are
          located. If this variable is  not  set,  the  .d  files
          remain in the same directory as the .c files.

          The -xprofile=tcov and the -xa options  are  compatible
          in a single executable. That is, you can link a program
          that contains some files which have been compiled  with
          -xprofile=tcov, and others with -xa. You cannot compile
          a single file with both options.

     -xarch=_a
          Specifies the set of instructions the compiler may use.

          _a must be one of the following depending on platform.

          On SPARC:  generic, v7, v8a, v8, v8plus,  v8plusa,  v9,
          v9a.

          On Intel:  generic, 386, pentium_pro.


          Although this option can be used alone, it is  part  of
          the  expansion  of the -xtarget option; its primary use
          is to override a value supplied by the -xtarget option.

          This option limits the instructions generated to  those
          of the specified architecture, and allows the specified
          set of instructions.  The option does not guarantee the
          specified set is used; however, under optimization, the
          set is usually used.

          If this option is used with optimization, the appropri-
          ate  choice can provide good performance of the execut-
          able on the specified  architecture.  An  inappropriate
          choice  can  result  in  serious degradation of perfor-
          mance.

          v7, v8, and v8a are all binary compatible.  v8plus  and
          v8plusa  are binary compatible with each other and for-
          ward, but not backward. For any particular choice,  the
          generated  executable  can run much more slowly on ear-
          lier architectures (to the left  in  the  above  list).
          See the _C _U_s_e_r'_s _G_u_i_d_e for details.

          v9, and v9a are binary compatible with each other,  but
          not backward compatible with the earlier architectures,
          and are available only on Solaris 7.

          Although this option can be used alone, it is  part  of
          the  expansion  of the -xtarget option; its primary use
          is to override a value supplied by the -xtarget option.

          This option specifies the  cache  properties  that  the
          optimizer  can use. It does not guarantee that any par-
          ticular cache property is used.

          The -xcache values are:

                Defines the cache properties for good performance
                on most SPARCs.  This is the default.

          _s_1/_l_1/_a_1
                Defines level 1 cache properties.

          _s_1/_l_1/_a_1:_s_2/_l_2/_a_2
                Defines levels 1 and 2 cache properties.

          The following values for -xcode are:

                  Code + data + bss size is limited to 2**32

                  architectures, 2**29 on 64-bit.

          The default is -xcode=abs32 for SPARC V8 and V7.  The
          default is -xcode=abs64 for SPARC and UltraSPARC V9
          (with -xarch=v9|v9a).

          When building shared dynamic libraries with -xarch=v9
          or v9a on 64-bit Solaris 7, a -xcode=pic13 or
          -xcode=pic32 option MUST also be specified.

     -xcrossfile[=_n]
          Enable optimization and inlining across source files
          (_S_P_A_R_C _O_n_l_y).

          If specified, _n may be 0, or 1.

          Normally, the scope of the compiler's analysis is lim-
          ited to each separate file on the command line. For
          example, -xO4's automatic inlining is limited to sub-
          programs defined and referenced within the same source
          file.

          With -xcrossfile, the compiler analyzes all the files
          named on the command line as if they had been con-
          catenated into a single source file.

          -xcrossfile is only effective when used with -xO4 or
          -xO5.

          The files produced from this compilation are inter-
          dependent (due to possible inlining) must be used as a
          unit when linking into a program. If any one routine is
          changed and the files recompiled, they must all be
          recompiled.

          As a result, use of this option will affect how
          makefiles are constructed.

          The default, if not specified on the command line, is
          -xcrossfile=0 and no cross file optimizations are per-
          formed. -xcrossfile is equivalent to -xcrossfile=1.

          Loop restructuring includes loop interchange, loop
          fusion, scalar replacement, and elimination of "dead"
          array assignments. If optimization is not at _----_xxxx_OOOO_3333 or
          higher, optimization is raised to _----_xxxx_OOOO_3333 and a warning is
          issued.

          Dependency analysis is included in
          -xautoparor-xparallel.  The dependency analysis is done
          at compile time.

          Dependency analysis may help on single-processor sys-
          tems. However, if you try _----_xxxx_dddd_eeee_pppp_eeee_nnnn_dddd on single-processor
          systems, you should not use either _----_xxxx_aaaa_uuuu_tttt_oooo_pppp_aaaa_rrrr or _----_xxxx_eeee_xxxx_----

     -xe  Performs only syntax and semantic checking on the
          source file, but does not produce any object or execut-
          able file.

     -xexplicitpar
          (_S_P_A_R_C) Parallelizes the loops that are specified.  You
          do the dependency analysis: analyze and specify loops
          for inter-iteration and data dependencies. The software
          parallelizes the specified loops. If optimization is
          not at -xO3 or higher, then it is raised to -xO3 and a
          warning is issued.

          Avoid -xexplicitpar if you do your own thread manage-
          ment.

          The Sun WorkShop includes the license required to use
          multiprocessor C options.  To get faster code, use this
          option on a multiprocessor system. On a single-
          processor system, the generated code usually runs
          slower.

          If you identify a loop for parallelization, and the
          loop has dependencies, you can get incorrect results,
          possibly different ones with each run, and with no
          warnings.  Do not apply an explicit parallel pragma to
          a reduction loop.  The explicit parallelization is
          done, but the reduction aspect of the loop is not done,
          and the results can be incorrect.

          If you use -xexplicitpar and compile and link in _o_n_e
          step, then linking automatically includes the micro-
          tasking library and the threads-safe C runtime library.
          If you use -xexplicitpar and compile and link in
          _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_e steps, then you must also _l_i_n_k with cc

          -xexplicitpar.

     -xF  Enables performance analysis of the executable using
          the WorkShop Analyzer.  (See analyzer(1) man pages.)
          Produces code that can be reordered at the function
          level.  Each function in the file is placed in a
          separate section; for example, functions foo() and
          bar() will be placed in the sections .text%foo and
          .text%bar , respectively.  Function ordering in the
          executable can be controlled by using -xF in conjunc-
          tion with the -M option to ld (see ld(1)).

          This option also causes the assembler to generate some
          debugging information necessary for data collection in
          the object file.

     -xhelp=_f
          Displays on-line help information.

          -xhelp=flags displays a summary of the compiler
          options;

          -xhelp=readme displays the readme file; -xhelp=errors
          displays the Error and Warning Messages file.

     -xildoff
          Turns off the incremental linker and forces the use of
          ld.  This option is the default if you do not use the
          -g option, or if you do use the -G option, or any
          source files are present on the command line.  Override
          this default by using the -xildon option.

     -xildon
          Turns on the incremental linker and forces the use of
          ild in _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l mode. This option is the default if
          you use the -g option, and you do not use the -G
          option, and there are no source files present on the
          command line. Use the -xildoff option to override this
          default.

     -xinline=[_f_1,...,_f_n]
          For user-written routines, tries to inline only those
          named in the list _f_1 to _f_n. It tries routines only in
          the file being compiled.  The list is a comma-separated
          list of functions and subroutines.

          If compiling with -xO3, you can use this option to
          increase optimization by inlining some routines.  The
          -xO3 option does not inline by itself.

          If compiling with -xO4, you can use this option to
          decrease optimization by restricting inlining to only
          those routines in the list. With -xO4, the compiler
          normally tries to inline all user-written subroutines
          and functions.  When xinline= is specified with an
          empty _rrrr_llll_iiii_ssss_tttt, it indicates that none of the routines in
          the source file are to be inlined.

          A routine is not inlined if any of the following apply
          (no warning is issued):
          o  Optimization is less than _----_xxxx_OOOO_3333
          o  The routine cannot be found
          o  Inlining the routine does not look profitable or
          safe to iropt
          o  The source for the routine is not in the file being
          compiled (however, see -xcrossfile).

     -xlibmieee
          Forces IEEE 754 style return values for math routines
          in exceptional cases.  In such cases, no exeception
          message will be printed, and errno should not be relied
          on.

     -xlibmil
          Inlines some library routines for faster execution.

     -xlic_lib_=_l

          libraries specified in _l, where _l is a comma-separated
          list of libraries.

     -xlicinfo
          Returns information about the licensing system.

          This option does not request a compilation nor check
          out a license.


     -xloopinfo
          (_S_P_A_R_C) Shows which loops are parallelized and which
          are not. This option is normally for use with the -xau-
          topar and -xexplicitpar options. The Sun WorkShop
          includes the license required to use multiprocessor C

     -xMerge
          (_S_P_A_R_C) Directs cc to merge the data segment with the
          text segment.  Data initialized in the object file pro-
          duced by this compilation is read-only and (unless
          linked with ld -N) is shared between processes.

     -xmaxopt=[off, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
          This command limits the level of pragma opt to the
          level specified. The default value is -xmaxopt=off
          which causes pragma opt to be ignored. If you specify
          -xmaxopt without supplying an argument, that is the
          equivalent of specifying -xmaxopt=5.

     -xnolib
          Does not link any libraries by default; that is, no -l
          options are passed to ld . Normally, the cc driver
          passes -lc to ld .

          When you use -xnolib , you have to pass all -l options
          yourself. For example:
               cc test.c -xnolib -Bstatic -lm -Bdynamic -lc
          links libm statically and the other libraries dynami-
          cally.

     -xnolibmil
          Does _n_o_t inline math library routines.  Use this after
          the -fast option:
          cc -fast -xnolibmil ...

     -xO [1|2|3|4|5]
          Optimizes the object code. Specifying -xO is equivalent
          to specifying -xO2.

          The _l_e_v_e_l_s (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) you can use differ
          according to the platform you are using.

               -xO1 Does basic local optimization (peephole).

               -xO2 Does basic local and global optimization.
                    This is induction variable elimination, local
                    and global common subexpression elimination,
                    algebraic simplification, copy propagation,
                    constant propagation, loop-invariant optimi-
                    zation, register allocation, basic block
                    merging, tail recursion elimination, dead
                    code elimination, tail call elimination and
                    complex expression expansion.

                    The -xO2 level does not assign global, exter-
                    nal, or indirect references or definitions to
                    registers. It treats these references and
                    definitions as if they were declared "vola-
                    tile." In general, the -xO2 level results in
                    minimum code size.

               -xO3 Performs like -xO2 but, also optimizes refer-
                    ences or definitions for external variables.
                    Loop unrolling and software pipelining are
                    also performed. The -xO3 level does not trace
                    the effects of pointer assignments. When com-
                    piling either device drivers, or programs
                    that modify external variables from within
                    signal handlers, you may need to use the
                    volatile type qualifier to protect the object
                    from optimization.  In general, the -xO3
                    level results in increased code size.

               -xO4 Performs like -xO3 but, also does automatic
                    inlining of functions contained in the same
                    file; this usually improves execution speed.
                    The -xO4 level does trace the effects of
                    pointer assignments.  In general, the -xO4
                    level results in increased code size.

               -xO5 Generates the highest level of optimization.
                    Uses optimization algorithms that take more
                    compilation time or that do not have as high
                    a certainty of improving execution time.
                    Optimization at this level is more likely to
                    improve performance if it is done with pro-
                    file feedback.

               (_x_8_6)

               -xO1 Preloads arguments from memory, cross jumping
                    (tail merging), as well as the single pass of
                    the default optimization.

               -xO2 Schedules both high- and low-level instruc-
                    tions and performs improved spill analysis,
                    loop memory-reference elimination, register
                    lifetime analysis, enhanced register alloca-
                    tion, and elimination of global common subex-
                    pression.

               -xO3 Performs loop strength reduction, induction
                    variable elimination, as well as the optimi-
                    zation done by level 2.

               -xO4 Performs loop unrolling, avoids creating
                    stack frames when possible, and automatically
                    inlines functions contained in the same file,
                    as well as the optimization done by levels 2
                    and 3. Note that this optimization level can
                    cause stack traces from _aaaa_dddd_bbbb and _dddd_bbbb_xxxx to be
                    incorrect.

               -xO5 Generates the highest level of optimization.
                    Uses optimization algorithms that take more
                    compilation time or that do not have as high
                    a certainty of improving execution time. Some
                    of these include generating local calling
                    convention entry points for exported func-
                    tions, further optimizing spill code, and
                    added analysis to improve instruction
                    scheduling.

               If the optimizer runs out of memory, it tries to
               recover by retrying the current procedure at a
               lower level of optimization and resumes subsequent
               procedures at the original level specified in the
               command-line option.

               If you optimize at -xO3 or -xO4 with very large
               procedures (thousands of lines of code in the same
               procedure), the optimizer may require a large
               amount of virtual memory.  In such cases, machine
               performance may degrade.

     -xP  Prints prototypes for K&R C function definitions.

     -xparallel
          (_S_P_A_R_C) Parallelizes loops both automatically (by the
          compiler) and explicitly (as specified by the program-
          mer). This option  is a macro and is equivalent to
          specifying all three of -xautopar, -xdepend, and
          -xexplicitpar.  With explicit parallelization, there is
          a risk of producing incorrect results.

          is raised to -xO3 and a warning is issued.

          Avoid -xparallel if you do your own thread management.

          The Sun WorkShop includes the license required to use
          the multiprocessor C options.  To get faster code, use
          this option on a multiprocessor SPARC system. On a
          single-processor system, the generated code usually
          runs more slowly.

          If you compile and link in _o_n_e step, -xparallel links
          with the microtasking library and the threads-safe C
          runtime library.  If you compile and link in _s_e_p_a_r_a_t_e
          steps, and you compile with -xparallel, then link with
          -xparallel.

     -xpentium
          (_x_8_6) Generates code for the Pentium processor.

     -xpg Prepares the object code to collect data for profiling
          with gprof(1).  Invokes a runtime recording mechanism
          that produces a gmon.out file (at normal termination).


     -xprefetch[={yes|no}]
          Use prefetch instructions on UltraSPARC II processors.
          (_S_P_A_R_C _O_n_l_y).

          With -xprefetch=yes, the compiler is free to insert
          prefetch instructions into the code it generates. This
          may result in a performance improvement on UltraSPARC
          II processors.

          The default if not specified is -xprefetch=no. Specify-
          ing -xprefetch alone is equivalent to -xprefetch=yes.


     -xprofile=_p
          Collects data for a profile or use a profile to optim-
          ize.

          _p must be collect[:_n_a_m_e], use[:_n_a_m_e], or tcov.

          This option causes execution frequency data to be col-
          lected and saved during execution, then the data can be
          used in subsequent runs to improve performance. This
          option is only valid when a level of optimization is
          specified.

          If compilation and linking are performed in separate
          steps, the same -xprofile option must appear on the
          compile as well as the link step.

          collect[:_n_a_m_e]
               Collects and saves execution frequency for later
               use by the optimizer with -xprofile=use. The com-
               piler generates code to measure statement execu-
               tion frequency.

               The _n_a_m_e is the name of the program that is being
               analyzed. This name is optional. If _n_a_m_e is not
               specified, a.out is assumed to be the name of the
               executable.

               At runtime, a program compiled with
               -xprofile=collect:_n_a_m_e will create the subdirec-
               tory _n_a_m_e.profile to hold the runtime feedback
               information. Data is written to the file feedback
               in this subdirectory. If you run the program
               several times, the execution frequency data accu-
               mulates in the feedback file; that is, output from
               prior runs is not lost.

          use[:_n_a_m_e]
               Uses execution frequency data to optimize strateg-
               ically. The _n_a_m_e is the name of the executable
               that is being analyzed. This name is optional. If
               _n_a_m_e is not specified, a.out is assumed to be the
               name of the executable.

               The program is optimized by using the execution
               frequency data previously generated and saved in
               the feedback files written by a previous execution
               of the program compiled with -xprofile=collect.

               The source files and other compiler options must
               be exactly the same as those used for the compila-
               tion that created the compiled program that gen-
               erated the feedback file If compiled with
               -xprofile=collect:_n_a_m_e, the same program name _n_a_m_e
               must appear in the optimizing compilation:
               -xprofile=use:_n_a_m_e.

          tcov
               Basic block coverage analysis using "new" style
               tcov.

               The -xprofile=tcov option is the new style of
               basic block profiling for tcov. It has similar
               functionality to the -xa option, but correctly
               collects data for programs that have source code
               in header files.  See also -xa for information on
               the old style of prfiling, the tcov(1) man page,

               Code instrumentation is performed similarly to
               that of the -xa option, but .d files are no longer
               generated. instead, a single file is generated,
               the name of which is based on the final execut-
               able.  for example, if the program is run out of
               /foo/bar/myprog.profile, the data file is stored
               in /foo/bar/myprog.profile/myprog.tcovd.

               The -xprofile=tcov and the -xa options are compa-
               tible in a single executable, that is, you can
               link a program that contains some files that have
               been compiled with -xprofile=tcov, and others with
               -xa. You cannot compile a single file with both
               options.

               When running tcov, you must pass it the -x option
               to make it use the new style of data. If not, tcov
               uses the old .d files, if any, by default for
               data, and produces unexpected output.

               Unlike the -xa option, the TCOVDIR environment
               variable has no effect at compile-time. However,
               its value is used at program runtime.  See

     -xreduction
          (_S_P_A_R_C) Analyzes loops for reduction in automatic
          parallelization. This option is valid only if -xreduc-
          tion one of -xautopar or -xparallel is also specified.
          Otherwise the compiler issues a warning.

          Parallelization options require a WorkShop license.

          When a reduction recognition is enabled, the compiler
          parallelizes reductions such as _d_o_t products, maximum
          and minimum finding. These reductions yield different
          roundoffs from those obtained by unparallelized code.


     -xregs=_r
          Specify register usage (_S_P_A_R_C _O_n_l_y).

          Specify usage of registers in generated code.

          _r is a comma-separated list of one or more of the fol-
          lowing:  [no%]appl, [no%]float.

                   fied in the SPARC ABI.

          no%float Do not use floating-point registers.

          The default is:  -xregs=appl,float.


     -xrestrict=_f
          (_S_P_A_R_C) Treats pointer-valued function parameters as
          restricted pointers. _f is a comma-separated list that
          consists of one or more function parameters, %all,
          %none.  This command-line option can be used on its
          own, but is best used with optimization of -xO3 or
          greater.

          The default is _%%%%_nnnn_oooo_nnnn_eeee. Specifying -xrestrict is
          equivalent to specifying -xrestrict=%all.

     -xs  Disables Auto-Read for dbx. Use this option in case you
          cannot keep the .o files around. It passes the -s
          option to the assembler.

          No Auto-Read is the older way of loading symbol tables.
          It places all symbol tables for dbx in the executable
          file. The linker links more slowly and dbx initializes
          more slowly.

          Auto-Read is the newer and default way of loading sym-
          bol tables. With Auto-Read, the information is distri-
          buted in the .o files, so that dbx loads the symbol
          table information only if and when it is needed. Hence,
          the linker links faster, and dbx initializes faster.

          With -xs, if you move the executables to another direc-
          tory, then to use dbx, you can ignore the object (.o)
          files.

          Without -xs, if you move the executables, you must move

          traps occur.

          This option grants permission to use the speculative
          load instruction on V9 machines. It is only effective
          when used with -xO5 optimization and
          -xarch=v8plus|v8plusa|v9|v9a is specified.

     -xsb Generates data for the WorkShop browser directory for
          the sbrowser(1) program, part of the SourceBrowser.
          This option is not valid with the _----_XXXX_ssss mode of the com-
          piler.

     -xsbfast
          Generates data for the Workshop browser directory for
          the sbrowser(1) program, part of the SourceBrowser.
          Does not compile source into an object file. This
          option is not valid with the _----_XXXX_ssss mode of the compiler.

     -xsfpconst
          Represents unsuffixed floating-point constants as sin-
          gle precision, instead of the default mode of double
          precision. Not valid with -Xc.

     -xspace
          Does no optimizations that increase code size. Does not
          parallelize loops if it increases code size.  Example:
          Does not unroll loops.

     -xstrconst
          Inserts string literals into the read-only data section
          of the text segment instead of the default data seg-
          ment.

     -xtarget=_t
          Specifies the target system for the instruction set and
          optimization.

          _t must be one of: native, generic, _s_y_s_t_e_m-_n_a_m_e.

          The -xtarget option permits a quick and easy specifica-
          tion of the -xarch, -xchip, and -xcache combinations
          that occur on real systems.  The only meaning of -xtar-
          get is in its expansion.

          The -fast macro option includes -xtarger=native in its
          expansion.

          -xtarget itself is a macro option which acts like a
          macro expansion on the command line for the -xarch
          -xchip and -xcache options. Therefore, you can override
          any of the expanded options by following -xtarget with
          the desired option.

               _d_i_r. No space is allowed within this option
               string. Without this option, temporary files go to

          -xtime
               Reports the time and resources used by each compi-
               lation.

          -xtransition
               Issues warnings for differences between K&R C and
               ANSI C.

          -xunroll=_n
               Specifies whether or not the compiler optimizes
               (unrolls) loops.  _n is a positive integer.  When _n
               is 1, it is a command and the compiler unrolls no
               loops.  When _n is greater than 1, -xunroll=_n
               merely suggests to the compiler that it unroll
               loops _n times.

          -xvpara
               (_S_P_A_R_C) Issues warnings about loops that have

               not be properly specified for parallelization.
               For example, when the compiler detects data depen-
               dencies between loop iterations, it issues a warn-
               ing.

               Use the -xexplicitpar or the -xparallel option and
               the #pragma MP directive.

               Specifies a new directory _d_i_r for the location of
               component _c.  _c can consist of any of the charac-
               ters representing tools listed under the -W

          -YA, _d_i_r
               Specifies a directory _d_i_r to search for all com-
               piler components.  If a component is not found in
               _d_i_r, the search reverts to the directory where the

          -Zlp (_S_P_A_R_C) Prepares object files for the loop pro-
