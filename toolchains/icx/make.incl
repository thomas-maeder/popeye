# -*- Makefile -*-
#

# Include file for makefile.unx for compiling on a Unix-ish platform
# (including MacOS X) for that same platform using the Intell C/C++
# compiler.
# I.e. host platform is equal to target platform.

# This file was successfully tested using version 11.0 on Linux/x86_64

# Requirements:
#
# The following tools can be used to produce executables for the host
# and target plarform and can be found in the $PATH
# Following the Intel oneAPI instructions you must have "sourced" /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh 
# in e.g. bash or zsh or equivalent to setup the environment
# - icx
# - ar
# - ranlib
# - strip


# Compiler selection
# ==================

# Compiler for creating executables on host
CCHOST=icx

# Linker for creating executables on host
LDHOST=icx

# Compiler for creating executables on target
CCTARGET=icx

# Linker for creating executables on target
LDTARGET=icx

# Strip utility to remove unnecessary symbols from executable
STRIPTARGET=strip

# ---------

# A library is called archive on Unix-ish platforms

# Archive generator
ARCHIVER = ar rv

# Archive index generator
ARCHIVE_INDEXER = ranlib
